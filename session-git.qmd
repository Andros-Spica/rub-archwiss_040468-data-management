# Git and GitHub

## Version-control and Git

### Version control: general concept and its usefulness  

Version control is a system that helps track and manage changes to files over time. It’s widely used in software development, but its applications extend to any field where file management is essential, including document editing, research, and project management. At its core, version control provides a historical record of changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions, identify when and why changes were made, and work collaboratively without the risk of overwriting each other’s work.

There are two main types of version control: centralized and distributed. Centralized version control systems, such as Subversion (SVN), store files in a central repository. Users check out files, make changes, and then commit them back to the central repository. While effective, centralized systems can be vulnerable if the central server fails. Distributed version control systems, like Git, address this by allowing every user to have a complete copy of the repository on their local machine. This setup enhances collaboration and provides redundancy, as users can work offline and synchronize changes with others when connected.

### Benefits of Version Control

- *Collaboration*: Version control systems make collaboration easier and more efficient by allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously. With distributed systems like Git, branches can be created for different features or tasks, and changes can later be merged into the main project seamlessly. This enables teams to work independently and minimize conflicts.

- *Historical Tracking*: Version control systems keep a detailed history of all changes made to the files. This allows users to see who made changes, when they were made, and why. If an issue arises, it’s possible to revert to a previous state without losing any data, making debugging easier.

- *Backup and Redundancy*: In distributed systems, each user’s local copy serves as a backup of the entire project. This redundancy reduces the risk of data loss due to server failures or other issues and allows users to work offline and sync changes later.

- *Version Management*: Version control systems assign unique identifiers (usually called “commits”) to each change. These identifiers allow users to switch between different versions of the project easily. It’s also possible to create branches for experimental features and merge them with the main project once they’re stable, facilitating smoother integration of new features.

- *Enhanced Workflow*: Many version control systems support automated processes such as Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), which streamline development and testing. These systems can automatically test changes before they are merged, ensuring higher code quality and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

Overall, version control systems are crucial tools in modern project management and development workflows. They enable collaboration, ensure data integrity, and improve productivity by providing a structured approach to managing changes in any type of project.

## Git terminology

Here are some essential Git terms to know:

::: {layout="[[2,1], [1]]"}

- **Repository**: A storage space for your project files and their history. Repositories can be local (on your computer) or remote (on platforms like GitHub).
  
- **Initialise**: configure a specific local directory as a working directory as a local repository by creating all necessary files for Git to work.

- **Add**/**Stage**: adds a change in the working directory to the staging area, telling Git to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, adding or staging doesn't really affect the repository since changes are not actually recorded until they are committed (see below).

:::

- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes in the repository. Each commit has a unique ID, allowing you to track and revert changes as needed [[1](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary)].

- **Branch**: A separate line of development. The default branch is usually called `main` or `master`. Branches allow you to work on features independently before merging them into the main project [[2](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/git-terms-explained)].

- **Merge**: The process of integrating changes from one branch into another. Typically, this involves merging a feature branch into the main branch.

- **Pull**: A command that fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch, ensuring your local work is up-to-date with the remote [[2](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/git-terms-explained)].

- **Push**: Uploads your commits from the local branch to the remote repository, making your changes available to others.

Understanding these terms is crucial for effective Git usage and collaboration in any project.

## GitHub

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that enables developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code repositories. It builds on Git, a version control system, by adding collaborative features like pull requests, issue tracking, and discussions, which make it easier for teams to work together on software projects. 

GitHub also offers hosting for open-source projects, allowing anyone to contribute or review code. With integrations for CI/CD, project management tools, and documentation, GitHub is a popular choice for developers worldwide to manage both personal and professional projects.

These workflows enable flexibility in how you manage your projects on GitHub.

### Markdown (GitHub-flavoured)

When Markdown files (.md) are placed in a GitHub repository, they will be automatically rendered within GitHub web interface by default, while the raw code can still be seen and edited in Markdown.

There are some particularities about how Markdown files will be rendered in GitHub through Internet browsers. Consult [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for knowing more about them.

### How to organise repositories

* Folders:   
    * `source` or `src` (source code)  
    * `doc` or `docs` (documentation)  

* Version tags  

### Conventional files

  * Files:  
    * README.md: Provides an overview of the project, including what it does, how to set it up, and how to contribute. A few sections examples are:  
      * General description  
      * Authors and/or contributors  
      * Acknowledgements  
      * Funding  
      * Installation or use instructions  
      * Contributing  
    * LICENSE: Specifies the terms under which the code can be used, modified, and distributed.  
    * CITATION.cff: human- and machine-readable citation information for software (and datasets). See example [here](https://citation-file-format.github.io/#:~:text=cff%20file%3F-,CITATION.,to%20correctly%20cite%20their%20software.).  
    * .gitignore: Lists files and directories that Git should ignore, such as build outputs and temporary files.  
    * CHANGELOG.md: Logs a chronological record of all notable changes made to the project, often following conventions like Conventional Commits.  
    * References.bib: one or more files containing references cited within the markdown files of the repository.  
* Releases and GitHub-Zenodo connection

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Hands-on Practice {.unnumbered}

* Task 1: start creating  
  * Create a profile repository with a README file following [GitHub Docs: Quickstart for writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github).  
  * Create another repository in GitHub, which will hold your work throughout the course. Make it public and initialise it with a README, .gitignore (template for R), and a license of you choice (in this case, we recommend CC0-1.0 or MIT; see [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/) and [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)). Add all other conventional files mentioned above, even if they remain empty for now. Edit your README file and commit/push your changes.   

* Task 2: making others' repositories your own's
  * Fork the Course Book repository.  
  * Clone your fork to a local directory.  
  * Modify or add a `.qmd` file and commit (one or more times).  
  * Push committed changes to your fork.  
  * Create a pull request back to the original repository.

* Task 3:  
  * Set up the GitHub-Zenodo connection.  
  * Publish your repository.  
  * Update README with the new Zenodo DOI (badge).
