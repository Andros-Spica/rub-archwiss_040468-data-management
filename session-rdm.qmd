## Introduction to Research Data

### What is data? What is it for?

Data refers to factual information, often in quantitative or qualitative form, used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. It serves as the foundational element for analysis and supports decision-making across diverse fields. In research, data helps to generate new insights, verify hypotheses, and contribute to the overall body of knowledge in a specific area.

### Archaeological Data: Particularities

In archaeology, data encompasses various types such as field notes, artefacts, images, geospatial coordinates, and more. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analysing this data, researchers can reconstruct past human behaviours, understand environmental contexts, and explore cultural practices.

Archaeological data is unique due to its diverse formats and the complexity of its collection. It often includes material remains like pottery, bones, tools, and structures, as well as environmental data like pollen samples and soil types. Since archaeological data often comes from excavation sites, it is usually non-renewable; once excavated, a site cannot be restored to its original state.

Archaeologists rely heavily on careful documentation to preserve as much information as possible for future study. Furthermore, the context in which artefacts are found is crucial, as it helps interpret their use, significance, and the broader cultural setting.

### Open Science

Open Science promotes transparency and collaboration in research by making methodologies, data, and findings accessible to the public and other researchers. In archaeology, this can involve sharing excavation reports, datasets, and analysis methods to facilitate wider understanding and scrutiny of findings.

### FAIR Principles

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable [@noauthor_what_nodate] and applies to data, *metadata*, and supporting infrastructure to ensure data is systematically organized and readily available for ongoing use and analysis.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### What is *metadata*? {.unnumbered}

Metadata refers to data that provides information about other data, rather than the content of the data itself. It describes various attributes such as the structure, format, location, and context of the data  [@noauthor_metadata_2024;@editor_metadata_nodate]. Examples include creation dates, file sizes, authorship details, and keywords, which help in organizing, understanding, and retrieving the associated data [@noauthor_what_nodate-1].

> *Example:*

> - **Data**: identification number, site of origin, and dates of items of a museum exhibition.  
> - **Metadata**: title and description of this data, author(s), date of last update, criteria for fixing site of origin, method(s) for establishing dates.

> Notice that, in this case, we could also choose to specify the information about dating method into the dataset, as long as we want or can specify this information for each item independently.

:::

A short breakdown of the concepts behind FAIR:

* **Findable**: Data should be easy to locate for humans and machines. This includes having:

  * A unique and persistent identifier.
  * Descriptive metadata.
  * Metadata containing data identifiers.
  * Registration in searchable resources.

* **Accessible**: Once found, data should be easy to access. This includes:

  * Retrieval via a standardized, open protocol.
  * Support for authentication and authorization when necessary.
  * Availability of metadata even if data itself is no longer available.
  
* **Interoperable**: Data should integrate with other data and tools. This requires:

  * Using a standardized, accessible language for data representation.
  * Using FAIR-aligned vocabularies.
  * Including references to related data.

* **Reusable**: Data should be well-described for reuse and replication in various contexts. This involves:

  * Detailed, relevant metadata.
  * Clear data usage licensing.
  * Documentation of data provenance.
  * Conformance to community standards.

These principles aim to enhance the usefulness of digital assets by ensuring they can be easily located, understood, and utilized by others [@lamprecht_towards_2020; @wilkinson_fair_2016]. Applying FAIR principles in archaeology involves creating well-documented, open-access datasets that other researchers can readily use [@hiebel_fair_2021;@lien-talks_how_2024;@nicholson_will_2023].

### Open Source

Open Source refers to software and tools that are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. For archaeologists, open-source tools can offer affordable solutions for data analysis, visualization, and data management, promoting a more inclusive research environment.

### Reproducibility

Reproducibility refers to the ability to replicate the results of a study using the original author's assets or following their methodology. It ensures that findings can be independently verified under similar conditions, reinforcing the reliability of scientific research [@national_academies_of_sciences_understanding_2019].

In scientific research, reproducibility is crucial for confirming the validity of experimental findings and building upon existing knowledge. It enhances transparency and trustworthiness in scientific practices, promoting better peer review and collaboration [@baker_1500_2016,@noauthor_grn_nodate].

Most research in archaeology does not necessarily involve controlled experiments and archaeological survey and excavation are destructive, thus unrepeatable. However, the reproducibility of data collection, processing and analysis is not a trivial concern.

Making research reproducible must be considered as a spectrum of practices, in which researchers should thrive for doing better, despite the challenges [@marwick_open_2017].

## Introduction to Programming for Research

### What is Programming?
Programming is the process of designing and implementing instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks. It involves writing code in various programming languages that communicate with the computer's hardware and software to solve problems, process data, and automate repetitive tasks. At its core, programming is about creating a sequence of steps, known as algorithms, which help achieve a desired outcome [@noauthor_what_2024].

### Importance of Learning Programming

For researchers, learning programming offers several significant advantages:

- *Efficiency and Automation*: Programming can help automate data collection, processing, and analysis, saving time and reducing human error. It also enables researchers to handle large datasets and complex calculations with ease.

- *Reproducibility*: Writing scripts to perform analysis allows other researchers to replicate experiments, thus ensuring results can be verified and reproduced, a fundamental aspect of scientific research.

- *Access to Powerful Tools*: With programming skills, researchers can access a wide range of tools for data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and simulation. These tools can enhance the scope and quality of research projects.

### Overview of Common Programming Languages

Several programming languages are popular in research due to their specific features and libraries[@noauthor_introduction_2018]:

- *Python*: Known for its readability and versatility, Python is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and automation. It has extensive libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, which are particularly useful for data-intensive research.

- *R*: A language specifically developed for statistical computing and graphics, R is preferred in data science, bioinformatics, and fields requiring extensive statistical analysis. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) offers thousands of packages that can handle a range of analytical tasks.

- *MATLAB*: Commonly used in engineering and scientific research, MATLAB excels at numerical computing, simulation, and algorithm development. It is particularly popular in fields like physics, engineering, and finance.

- *JavaScript*: While primarily a web development language, JavaScript is also used in research for developing interactive data visualizations and web-based applications.

### Concept of Research Software: Tools and Scripts

Research software comprises tools, libraries, and scripts that aid in conducting and managing research activities. It can range from simple scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing to complex software packages for statistical analysis and simulation. Although any software used in research could be considered as research software, advance training focus on programming or scripting skills, not on graphical user interface operations (e.g., creating a plot in R or Python rather than in Microsoft Excel).

- *Tools*: Research software tools like [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), etc., offer integrated development environments (IDEs) tailored to a specific range of languages, enhancing productivity and facilitating code sharing and version control.

- *Scripts*: Scripts are text files encoding programs written to perform specific tasks. In research, scripts are often used for data cleaning, model training, and result visualization. Scripts can be used even to generate and format an entire dataset (have a peek on how the [course schedule has been built with R code](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/rub-archwiss_040468-data-management/blob/main/index.qmd)). These scripts can be shared among researchers to ensure that analyses are reproducible and consistent.

Learning programming for research allows scientists to leverage these tools and scripts effectively, making research more efficient, reproducible, and insightful.

### Markdown: a language in between

As already mentioned, [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a markup language with minimal syntax, designed for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor [@noauthor_markdown_nodate]. For us, humans, Markdown is easily readable and editable as text. However, it is technically a programming language, as it holds machine-readable instructions (i.e. program) which, once compiled (or rendered) by the right software, produces the desired output in form of a formatted text. A advanced text editor, such as Microsoft Word, allow you to do exactly the same (and more), but only through a sequence of interactions with the graphic user interface (GUI).

Writing in Markdown or "writing Markdown code" is straightforward and will only require some getting use to, especially if you costumed to advanced text editors. For example, instead of marking a fragment of text in bold font through the usual steps, we would do it by typing \*\* (two asterisks) before and after the fragment.

To illustrate this, consider the rendering and source code of a markdown text:

"**Live** *as if* you were to **_die tomorrow_**. **Learn** *as if* you were to **_live forever_**." - Mahatma Gandhi, Source: [BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com/citation/quotes/mahatma_gandhi_133995)

```markdown
"**Live** *as if* you were to **_die tomorrow_**. **Learn** as if you were to **_live forever_**."

Mahatma Gandhi, Source: [BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com/citation/quotes/mahatma_gandhi_133995)
```

The simplicity of this language might feel unnecessary, or even annoying, but it is actually the trait that opens a great range of potential applications. Markdown is today indispensable for all practices related to open science and can offer a good entry point for other, more complex programming languages.
