## Introduction to Research Data

### What is data? What is it for?

Data refers to factual information, often in quantitative or qualitative form, used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. It serves as the foundational element for analysis and supports decision-making across diverse fields. In research, data helps to generate new insights, verify hypotheses, and contribute to the overall body of knowledge in a specific area.

### Archaeological Data: Particularities

In archaeology, data encompasses various types such as field notes, artifacts, images, geospatial coordinates, and more. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing this data, researchers can reconstruct past human behaviors, understand environmental contexts, and explore cultural practices.

Archaeological data is unique due to its diverse formats and the complexity of its collection. It often includes material remains like pottery, bones, tools, and structures, as well as environmental data like pollen samples and soil types. Since archaeological data often comes from excavation sites, it is usually non-renewable; once excavated, a site cannot be restored to its original state.

Archaeologists rely heavily on careful documentation to preserve as much information as possible for future study. Furthermore, the context in which artifacts are found is crucial, as it helps interpret their use, significance, and the broader cultural setting.

### Open Science

Open Science promotes transparency and collaboration in research by making methodologies, data, and findings accessible to the public and other researchers. In archaeology, this can involve sharing excavation reports, datasets, and analysis methods to facilitate wider understanding and scrutiny of findings.

### FAIR Principles

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. These principles aim to enhance the usefulness of digital assets by ensuring they can be easily located, understood, and utilized by others. Applying FAIR principles in archaeology involves creating well-documented, open-access datasets that other researchers can readily use.

### Open Source

Open Source refers to software and tools that are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. For archaeologists, open-source tools can offer affordable solutions for data analysis, visualization, and data management, promoting a more inclusive research environment.

### Reproducibility

Reproducibility refers to the ability to replicate the results of a study using the original author's assets or following their methodology. It ensures that findings can be independently verified under similar conditions, reinforcing the reliability of scientific research.

In scientific research, reproducibility is crucial for confirming the validity of experimental findings and building upon existing knowledge. It enhances transparency and trustworthiness in scientific practices, promoting better peer review and collaboration.

Most research in archaeology does not necessarily involve controlled experiments and archaeological survey and excavation are destructive, thus unrepeatable. However, the reproducibility of data collection, processing and analysis is not a trivial concern.

Making research reproducible must be considered as a spectrum of practices, in which researchers should thrive for doing better, despite the challenges [@marwick_open_2017].
