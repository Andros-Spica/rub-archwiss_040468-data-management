	doi = {10.17605/OSF.IO/3D6XX},
	abstract = {In archaeology, we are accustomed to investing great effort into collecting data from fieldwork, museum collections, and other sources, followed by detailed description, rigorous analysis, and in many cases ending with publication of our findings in short, highly concentrated reports or journal articles. Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as ‘open science’, these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology’s Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.

In the 17th century, scientists would communicate through letters and were able to understand and assimilate major developments across all the emerging major disciplines. In 2016—the most recent year for which data are available—more than 2,295,000 scientific and engineering research articles were published worldwide (National Science Foundation, 2018e). In addition, the number of scientific and engineering fields and subfields of research is large and has greatly expanded in recent years, especially in fields that intersect disciplines (e.g., biophysics); more than 230 distinct fields and subfields can now be identified. The published literature is so voluminous and specialized that some researchers look to information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to track and apprehend the important work in their own fields.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an approach how to create FAIR data for prehistoric mining archaeology, based on the CIDOC CRM ontology and semantic web standards. The interdisciplinary Research Centre HiMAT (History of mining activities in the Tyrol and adjacent areas, University of Innsbruck) investigates mining history from prehistoric to modern times with an interdisciplinary approach. One of the projects carried out at the research centre is the multinational DACH project “Prehistoric copper production in the eastern and central Alps”. For a specific geographical region of the project, the data transformation to open and re-usable data is investigated in a separate Open Research Data pilot project. The methodological approach will use the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. Every archaeological investigation in Austria has to be documented according to the requirements of the Austrian Federal Monuments Office. This documentation is deposited in the CERN-based EU supported research data repository ZENODO. For each deposited file, metadata are created through the application of the conceptual metadata schema CIDOC CRM, an ISO standard for Cultural Heritage Information, which was adopted by ARIADNE, the European Union Research Infrastructure for archaeological resources. Concepts specific to mining archaeology research are organized with the DARIAH Back Bone Thesaurus, a model for sustainable interoperable thesauri maintenance, developed in the European Union Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities. Metadata are created through the extraction of information from the documentation and the transformation to a knowledge graph using semantic web standards. To facilitate usage, graph data are exported to hierarchical and tabular formats representing sites and objects with their geographic locations, temporal and typological assignments and links to the research activities and documents. Metadata are deposited together with the documentation into the repository.},

	abstract = {A fundamental task of archaeology is to address challenging scientific questions related to the complexity of human societies. If we are to systematically understand the processes that affect human societies on multiple spatial and temporal scales, research leveraging existing archaeological data is essential. However, only a fraction of the data from archaeological projects are publicly findable or accessible, let alone interoperable or reusable. This is the case despite statements of disciplinary ethics, availability of capable technologies for data stewardship, publications providing guidance, and legal mandates. This article introduces the FAIR principles for data stewardship in North American archaeology, which state that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We call for efforts to promote widespread adoption of the FAIR and CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles among professional organizations, publishers, data repositories, and researchers. We also call for adoption and implementation of requirements to adhere to these principles by governmental agencies, funding bodies, and other regulators of archaeological research. Ultimately, adoption of the FAIR principles in an ethical framework contributes to our understanding of our human experience and can lead to greater integration and reuse of research results, fostering increased partnerships between academia and industry., Una tarea fundamental de la arqueología es abordar preguntas científicas desafiantes relacionadas con la complejidad de las sociedades humanas. Si queremos comprender sistemáticamente los procesos que afectan a las sociedades humanas en múltiples escalas espaciales y temporales, investigaciones que hagan uso de datos arqueológicos existentes es esencial. Sin embargo, sólo una fracción de los datos de los proyectos arqueológicos se pueden encontrar o son públicamente accesibles, sin importar que sean interoperables o reutilizables. Este es el caso a pesar de las declaraciones de ética disciplinaria, la disponibilidad de tecnologías capaces para la administración de datos, publicaciones que brindan orientación y mandatos legales. Este artículo presenta los principios FAIR para la administración de datos en la arqueología de América del Norte, los cuales establecen que los datos deben ser localizables, accesibles, interoperables y reutilizables. Pedimos mayor esfuerzo para promover la adopción generalizada de los principios FAIR y CARE (beneficio colectivo, autoridad para controlar, responsabilidad y ética) entre organizaciones profesionales, editores, repositorios de datos e investigadores. También hacemos un llamado a la adopción e implementación de requisitos para adherirse a estos principios por parte de agencias gubernamentales, organismos de financiación y otros reguladores de la investigación arqueológica. En última instancia, la adopción de los principios FAIR en un marco ético contribuye a nuestra comprensión de nuestra experiencia humana y puede conducir a una mayor integración y reutilización de los resultados de la investigación, fomentando una mayor asociación entre la academia y la industria.},

Descriptive metadata – the descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
Structural metadata – metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.
Administrative metadata – the information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.
Reference metadata – the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
Statistical metadata – also called process data, may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.
Legal metadata – provides information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing, if provided.
Metadata is not strictly bound to one of these categories, as it can describe a piece of data in many other ways.},

	abstract = {Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. The open source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.
A main principle of open source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in open source appropriate technology, and open source drug discovery.
Open source promotes universal access via an open-source or free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. Before the phrase open source became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of other terms. Open source gained hold with the rise of the Internet. The open-source software movement arose to clarify copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues.
Generally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community. Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement, including the Apache Software Foundation, which supports community projects such as the open-source framework Apache Hadoop and the open-source HTTP server Apache HTTP.},

This edited volume is designed to discuss important issues around open access to data and software in academic and commercial archaeology, as well as to summarise both the current state of theoretical engagement, and technological development in the field of open-archaeology. Ben Edwards Ben Edwards was trained in archaeology at the University of Durham, achieving his BA, MA and PhD. His first commercial work was for Archaeological Services, Durham University, before moving on to become a Lecturer in Archaeological Practice at the University of Liverpool, where he taught for three years. During this time Ben began his project management work, undertaking both commercial and research excavations, and survey projects. His teaching (archaeological practice and heritage management) proved to be an excellent basis from which to develop his professional expertise. Ben now lectures at Manchester Metropolitan University in Archaeology and Heritage. He currently researches open source software and hardware for use in the field, and advanced 3D surveying techniques. Andrew Wilson Andrew Wilson was trained in archaeology at the University of Liverpool. Upon achieving his BA at the University, Andrew moved south to study Computer Applied Archaeology at the University of Southampton, where he was awarded an MSc. Andrew returned to the University of Liverpool where he has recently completed a PhD. During this time Andrew coordinated a number of projects both in the UK and Middle East, specialising in advanced surveying techniques of archaeological remains. Working in the the School of Computer Science, Bangor University Andrew has developed his keen interest in Open data policies and ethics. This interest was the starting point for this volume.},

The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present examples of their application.},

	abstract = {In computer science, control flow (or flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. The emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an imperative programming language from a declarative programming language.
Within an imperative programming language, a control flow statement is a statement that results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. For non-strict functional languages, functions and language constructs exist to achieve the same result, but they are usually not termed control flow statements.
A set of statements is in turn generally structured as a block, which in addition to grouping, also defines a lexical scope.
Interrupts and signals are low-level mechanisms that can alter the flow of control in a way similar to a subroutine, but usually occur as a response to some external stimulus or event (that can occur asynchronously), rather than execution of an in-line control flow statement.
At the level of machine language or assembly language, control flow instructions usually work by altering the program counter. For some central processing units (CPUs), the only control flow instructions available are conditional or unconditional branch instructions, also termed jumps.},
