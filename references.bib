	doi = {10.17605/OSF.IO/3D6XX},
	abstract = {In archaeology, we are accustomed to investing great effort into collecting data from fieldwork, museum collections, and other sources, followed by detailed description, rigorous analysis, and in many cases ending with publication of our findings in short, highly concentrated reports or journal articles. Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as ‘open science’, these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology’s Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.

In the 17th century, scientists would communicate through letters and were able to understand and assimilate major developments across all the emerging major disciplines. In 2016—the most recent year for which data are available—more than 2,295,000 scientific and engineering research articles were published worldwide (National Science Foundation, 2018e). In addition, the number of scientific and engineering fields and subfields of research is large and has greatly expanded in recent years, especially in fields that intersect disciplines (e.g., biophysics); more than 230 distinct fields and subfields can now be identified. The published literature is so voluminous and specialized that some researchers look to information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to track and apprehend the important work in their own fields.},

The Turing Way book is collaboratively developed by its diverse community of researchers, learners, educators, and other stakeholders. The Turing Way project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. In 2020, the project underwent a major overhaul categorising chapters into 5 guides on reproducible research, project design, collaboration, communication and ethical research. Additionally, we added a community handbook to document all the practices designed and implemented towards the development of the project and community. This release in 2021 includes additional chapters developed by our contributors across five guides and the community handbook. In addition, all the project documents from the project are provided as they appear on The Turing Way GitHub repository including the Zenodo metadata: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
