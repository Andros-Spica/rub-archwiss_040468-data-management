## Using GIS Databases for Archaeology

* **Introduction to Spatial Databases**  
  * Overview of spatial databases and their use in archaeology (e.g., storing geospatial excavation data).  
  * Example: Introduction to PostGIS for spatial data management in PostgreSQL.  
* **Linking GIS Data to Databases**  
  * Using databases to manage spatial data for archaeological analysis.  
  * Example: Storing site coordinates and linking them to excavation records in a spatial database.  
* **Querying Spatial Data**  
  * Writing spatial queries to retrieve geospatial data from a database.  
  * Example: Querying sites within a specific radius or extracting artifact distributions across layers.
